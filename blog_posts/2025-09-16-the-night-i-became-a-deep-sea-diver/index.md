Last night, the second night after installing WatchOS 26, my Apple Watch 10 went rogue. While I was sleeping, it decided I was a professional diver, plunging into water a scorching 127 degrees Celsius. It woke me up with a screen bright as a supernova. Even 3 restarts later, the watch was still convinced I was mid-dive, recording a workout I couldn’t stop. I gave up, shoved it aside, and managed to grab one extra hour of sleep.

After my morning shower, I finally managed to end the dive, delete the workout, and even uninstall the rogue diving app. I thought the nightmare was over.

I was wrong. By the afternoon, the watch again had saved over 500 training minutes and 2000 calories, all without a single logged workout. Even after deleting the data from Apple Health for the whole day, the “superdiver” stats were still there and the medals were proudly displayed, mocking me.

So, I made 2 decision: First, I resettled my Apple Watch without restoring it from a backup, and secondly I’m eating ice cream until the calorie deficit is properly addressed and my mood is restored.
